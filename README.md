JavaScript Module
## Overview of Projet
This project was my introduction to JavaScript.  The challenge was to create an interactive web page which allows a user to filter data regarding UFO sightings throughout the United states and Canada.  The data included a date, city, state, country, time, shape and short description of the event.  The finished product used CSS and Bootstrap to help style the page, as well as user inputed fields to filter the data to their preference.
## Results
A simple single web page with filterable data fields is the finished product.  Users can easily enter a variety of information into the filter boxes on the left of the screen to return specific data about strange events involving UFO's they may be interested in. ![filters](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111530580/201247376-7f483e2a-c12c-446f-9088-0d0b1f28bd85.png)

With their chosen fields entered, they will be able to see specific events reported in their area, date or shape of choice.

## Summary
One drawback of this page is that the user must write their querys in exactly the correct case and punctuation for it to work.  For example Benton, Arkansas must be searched as "benton" and "ar".  One could modify the code to include more loose interpretations of the data to help a user out, or better yet include drop down bars to eliminate user error.<br>
Furthermore, the data could be cleaned up.  Some time durations are actually time of day and should be in the same format.  Also, some shapes could be combined for example "sphere" and "circle".  This would help the users to retun the data they are looking for. <br>
The data set is also somewhat short.  A more comprehensive list would probably improve the user experience.  A quick google search returned numerous UFO related API's which could be used for this purpose.
